            <h3>Frontened Developer!</h3>
            <p>Hello! I'm Khushi. I'm from NIT Kurukshetra and I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's in Mechanical
                Engineering. I'm also studying frontend development, and learning the skills and technologies needed to
                create visually appealing and interactive websites and applications. I've a good knowledge of languages
                such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as I'm also learning more and more about frameworks such as
                React or Angular. As a frontend developer, My main focus is on the user interface and user experience of
                a website or application. I like designing and implementing the visual elements, layout, and
                functionality that users interact with. In addition to technical skills, I'm also developing my
                problem-solving and communication skills. I think , as a frontend developer, I can have a critical role
                in creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences for users around the world.</p>

            <p>Along with web development, I'm also developing my skills in Data Analytics. I'm a critical thinker as
                I'm skilled in collecting, cleaning, and analyzing large sets of data, with the ultimate goal of
                deriving meaningful insights and solutions. I have a strong understanding of statistical methods, data
                visualization, and programming languages such as SQL and Python. I'm able to work with various types of
                data, including structured and unstructured data, and am proficient in using various data analysis tools
                and software like Power Bi. In addition to technical skills, I'm also an excellent communicator and
                collaborator. I'm able to present complex data analysis in a clear and understandable manner, and also
                able to adapt my communication style to different audiences.</p>
